# Notes App

This is the code for a command line based notes app which utilises JS modules like FS, Chalk, yargs etc. This is the first instance of me building a project with JS, a language that I have just been acquainted with. Coded this in tandem with a Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/).
